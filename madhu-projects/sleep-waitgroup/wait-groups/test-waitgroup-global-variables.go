/*
Global Declaration:
var wg sync.WaitGroup allows wg to be accessed by both the main and madhu functions.

Using defer wg.Done():
This ensures that wg.Done() is called when the madhu function completes, even if thereâ€™s an error or panic.

wg.Add(2):
Adds to the counter, indicating that we are waiting for one goroutine.

wg.Wait():
Blocks until all added goroutines have called wg.Done().
